#Implementation practice of Data Structures in Ruby

##link_list is modeled using a Racetrack and Car example rather than list or node.

A singlely linked list is a data type similar to arrays or hashes.
Each node or car for example keeps track only of the one in front of it.
You can currently add, search, remove a single node. As well as print out all of the nodes.

##Stack models a stack data structure. it uses list and node as objects.

A stack is a abstract data structure. Following the FILO(first in, last out) idea.

##Queue models a queue data structure. It uses a queue and a item as objects.

A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.

##A Binary tree is a data structure where each node has at most two children.
This implementation models the data and then sorts them accordingly.

###A Rakefile is included so just run "rake" to see the tests pass.
