#Implementation practice of a single linked list in ruby

##Modeled using a Racetrack and Car example rather than List or Node.

A singlely linked list is a data type similar to arrays or hashes.
Each node or car for example keeps track only of the one in front of it.
You can currently add, search, remove a single node. As well as print out all of the nodes.

A Rakefile is included so just run "rake" to see the tests pass.
