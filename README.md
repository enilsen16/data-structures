#Implementation practice of Data Structures in Ruby

##link_list is modeled using a Racetrack and Car example rather than List or Node.

A singlely linked list is a data type similar to arrays or hashes.
Each node or car for example keeps track only of the one in front of it.
You can currently add, search, remove a single node. As well as print out all of the nodes.

##stack models a stack data structure. it uses List and Node as objects.

A stack is a abstract data structure. Following the FILO(first in, last out) idea.

##queue models a queue data structure. It uses a Queue and a Item as objects.

A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.

  
A Rakefile is included so just run "rake" to see the tests pass.
